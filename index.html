                My name is Joshua and I was born and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts. I moved to Denver, Colorado in 2015 looking for new adventures and to enjoy the beauty that Colorado has to offer! Ive worked a wide variety of jobs throughout my young life from working in a restaurant as a cook and bartender to running landscape construction projects. I consider myself as someone that likes to always be tested and someone who loves a good challenge.

    Growing up I was always a very tech savvy person that enjoyed the technologies that computers had to offer. I initially went to college right after high school to pursue a degree in computer science but I wasn’t committed as I had to be. Trying everything from trades to sales to working in a juvenile detention center, my love for computers and understanding how they function never left! I finally decided to leave my comfort zone and chase after something that to me, doesn’t feel like a job, rather something that I love and enjoy! I’ve always been a hands on learner and someone that could pick up on something  quick that was shown to me physically and through some mutual friends I was introduced to the DU coding bootcamp! I am very excited about my future as a full stack developer!
